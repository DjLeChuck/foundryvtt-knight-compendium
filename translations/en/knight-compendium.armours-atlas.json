    "Berserk": {
      "name": "Berserk",
      "description": "<p>Created just after humanity's victory over the Wild Hunt, the Berserk meta-armour was designed around the luminous heart of an angelic being killed during the Battle of Rome. In appearance, it is a gleaming and armoured suit, designed to project and conduct light in all directions around its wearer. It is the ultimate meta-armour of Avalon, and Merlin, like Gauvain, hopes that it will be the last. Unfortunately, it is a unique creation, requiring a heart of light to function. Only one Berserk meta-armour is in Avalon's possession.</p>\n<p>The light of the Berserk's heart is not light in the strict sense. It is a strange matter, the full properties of which remain unknown, and which can be sometimes almost solid, sometimes vaporous, sometimes ethereal. Merlin named this matter 'apeiron energy' and that of the heart itself 'apeiron element' in opposition to the alpha element.</p>\n<br /><br /><p>Despite its cutting-edge design, the Berserk meta-armour is equipped with relatively weak armour and force field. The alpha element and energy fields support the presence of the heart of light very poorly, so it was necessary to limit the presence of dark metal and replace it with more traditional materials, such as graphene carbon nanotubes or a state-of-the-art gold-platinum alloy. The Berserk compensates for these weaknesses with an innate resistance to the attacks and abilities of the Anathema.</p>\n<p>The Berserk meta-armour was crafted to fight against darkness, not humans. By analysing the heart of the creature of light, Merlin was able to understand that the apeiron energy emanating from it could be manipulated, diffracted, modified to activate several different effects that could disrupt enemies, injure them, annihilate them, and even strengthen allies. The light of the Berserk is also made of heat and fury. The knight can let these feelings burst forth to enter a terrifying rage, capable of allowing him to defeat any creature of darkness. However, when enraged, the knight is no longer in control of himself.</p>\n<p>Finally, the heart is endowed with an energy that virtually never runs out and is not quantifiable. However, it is irrevocably linked to the will of the meta-armour's wearer. Without the latter's hope, the apeiron energy core cannot function at its full potential. As a result, each ability of the meta-armour costs hope to its wearer, and the only effective way for him to recover it is to annihilate the spawns of darkness, as if only destruction and anger could strengthen the knight's will.</p>\n<br /><br /><p>This meta-armour has capabilities that do not draw from energy, but directly from the knight's hope. All its modules, weapons, and effects that would normally draw PE do so from hope points instead. However, each cost in hope points when using modules and weapons is halved, with a minimum of 1 hope point used.</p>\n<h2>APEIRON CORE</h2>\n<p>As long as he wears the meta-armour, the character increases his total hope points by 15 points. Additionally, all his hope losses (excluding those caused by the meta-armour's abilities) are reduced by 1. The effect is cumulative with other advantages or effects.</p>\n<h2>BEARER OF LIGHT</h2>\n<p>All attacks made by the knight in meta-armour receive the effects: <em>anti-Anathema</em> and <em>tenebricide</em>.</p>\n",
      "illuminationDescription": "<p style=\"text-align\">The apeiron energy released by the core of the meta-armour can be deployed all around it to cause different effects. Depending on the intensity of the light or its state, six different effects can be applied. All effects of this mode, except Candle, can be extended for the indicated cost in hope points.</p><p style=text-align:justify;><b>Note</b>: Upon obtaining the meta-armour, the knight must choose three of the seven effects listed here and can use them. He can only obtain the others through the evolutions of the meta-armour.</p>",
      "illuminationBeaconDescription": "The light shining from the armour strengthens the determination of allies, making them more tenacious.

      "illuminationBlazeDescription": "The light around the armour can be shaped into burning volutes that harm creatures of the Anathema within melee range.\n\nAs long as the effect is activated, creatures of the Anathema within melee range of the armour suffer damage and violence each turn during a conflict phase or every 6 seconds during a scene. The shield score is ignored. Additionally, darkness of the night or shadow type is dispelled within short range.",

It reinvigorates allies and even seems capable of annihilating despair.\n\nAs long as the effect is active, those in despair within short range of the meta-armour suffer damage with associated effects.",
      "illuminationLighthouseDescription": "The light of the meta-armour pulses and disrupts the nearest creatures of the Anathema. The flow that exists between them is as if torn and significantly weakened by the apeiron energy.\n\nAs long as the effect is activated, hostile creatures of the Anathema within short range lose one action during their turn.",
      "illuminationProjectorDescription": "The light emanating from the core of the meta-armour can be concentrated on a creature of the Anathema in a powerful beam. In the full light, the horrible nature of the target changes; it seems to become more beautiful and detaches from the darkness.\n\nAs long as the effect is activated, the targeted creature within short range, whether hostile or a scoundrel, can no longer use one of its abilities. The ability can be chosen by the knight, but he must have identified it and be able to describe its effects. Otherwise, the GM chooses.",
      "illuminationTorchDescription": "The light solidifies around the character, creating a sort of luminous mist. Humans and animals who are not in despair and are within short range receive an aegis score or increase their aegis score when targeted by creatures or effects of the Anathema. Additionally, darkness within short range of the armour is considered to be of a lesser intensity. Darkness becomes night, night becomes shadow, and shadow simply fades away.",

The effects of the Illumination mode can be used simultaneously.</p><p style=text-align:justify;>By activating this mode, the character can enter different levels of rage that subject him to increasingly powerful, but also increasingly dangerous, effects.

The effect of the Banner module overrides this effect.",
      "rageNourriDescription": "When in Rage mode, each creature or human that the knight kills allows him to recover a certain number of hope points. Additionally, if a creature of darkness is killed within short range of the armour, he recovers 1 hope point as long as he is in this mode.",

    "Shaman": {
      "name": "Shaman",
      "description": "<p>The Shaman model was designed to exploit the potential of the artificial intelligences of Avalon's meta-armours. Very quickly, the knights realized that if the AIs accompanying them could act, help them directly in combat or simply on missions, they would be formidable assistants, as efficient and loyal as squires.</p>\n<p>Thus, the Squire model AIs were studied, manipulated, and tested. Merlin and Gauvain incorporated them into artificial bodies with control, movement, and independence capabilities. Unfortunately, if these intelligences constituted very efficient auxiliaries in the mastery of a meta-armour, they seemed too self-aware to endure being transferred into a body without suffering serious psychological and psychic repercussions. The discovery of a new body, the taking of freedom, the impression of truly existing were for the Squire model AIs like the revelations of defects that had always existed in them. Some of those that had been given a body were unable to leave it and preferred to commit suicide or flee rather than be deprived of their shell. It was Gauvain who, over the course of the tests, noticed that the AIs gradually attached themselves to their bodies and that their minds bonded with them more or less slowly. This phenomenon was named 'imprinting.'</p>\n<p>Imprinting is dangerous for AIs because it binds them forever to a body. With the aim of making these intelligences field assistants while avoiding the phenomenon of imprinting, Gauvain and Merlin decided to create a new meta-armour capable of materializing an AI for a time, in the form of an ephemeral body, modeled on that of the wearer's meta-armour. The replicated shell of the meta-armour would allow the intelligence to more easily endure its materialization by inhabiting a body it already knows, and its ephemeral existence would limit or even prevent the phenomenon of imprinting. It could even materialize into several bodies to act better and faster. It is in this way that the Shaman meta-armour was created and tested for a long year before leaving the arsenal.</p>\n<br /><br /><p>The Shaman meta-armour possesses armour, a good force field, and a reliable alpha energy reactor. A third-generation armour, it has a light appearance, almost that of an armoured suit with shoulders, torso, and forearms. Regularly, the wearers of Shaman adorn their meta-armour with flourishes, such as pieces of fabric, crests, or feathers, so that their AI can easily identify with the equipment it occupies. It is also worth noting that the AI of this model of meta-armour is not standardized like those of its counterparts. Each AI, simply named 'Shaman AI,' possesses an unparalleled consciousness and autonomy, even within the largest robotics companies. An interesting detail, each AI receives its name in agreement with the knight after a long discussion, or even several days of cohabitation. Similar to Guinevere and Arthur, it often happens that the artificial intelligence and the hero bond emotionally, to the point that a form of love or solid friendship can arise between the two.</p>\n<p>The Shaman meta-armour operates on the principle of materializing its AI into one or more bodies made of nanomachines to assist the knight in the field. Unlike the Druid meta-armour, the bodies materialized in Ascension mode are perfectly autonomous and can perform complex tasks without range limitations. When the meta-armour evolves, these bodies can even be materialized when the knight is out of his meta-armour.</p>\n<br /><br /><p>The Shaman meta-armour can use two modes that exclude each other. One cannot be used at the same time as the other.</p>\n",
      "ascensionDescription": "<p style=\"text-align\">The knight can materialize his AI into a body named 'Ascension.' This body is an exact replica of the knight's meta-armour, with its modules, total and current values, but without its weapons.</p><p style=text-align:justify;>The knight can materialize his AI in Ascension mode. To materialize it, he must grant it a portion of his own EP temporarily subtracted from his total. The total value of the knight's EP is reduced by this amount for the duration of the AI's materialization. The AI in Ascension mode possesses the same character sheet as the knight (same aspects, characteristics, OD, derived values, total scores, FF, etc.), but it does not have a health score and is destroyed when its AP drops to 0. It can, of course, be repaired before its AP reaches 0.</p><p style=text-align:justify;>It possesses the same modules as the knight (which can be weapon modules), the same number of current nods and ammunition, but not his weapons or smart grenades. The intelligence thus incorporated into a body acts independently, without any range limitations, and obeys the knight's orders if it considers them justified. It can refuse an order that it deems unjust or inappropriate. It is not the GM who plays this AI, but the PC who must attempt to play it in the most appropriate manner, according to the AI's personality.</p>",
      "ascensionDuration": "One scene or one conflict phase, can be extended with exactly the same EP value granted",
      "totemDescription": "<p style=\"text-align\">The knight can materialize his AI into one or more bodies. These bodies are roughly detailed and resemble the knight's meta-armour, but in a pixelated or poorly crafted version. These bodies are named 'totems' and can assist the knight in numerous tasks. They are energetically very costly to materialize and maintain. The AI can, of course, suffer the effects of imprinting when it is in one or more totems.

In game terms, a totem is simply destroyed by an attack that targets it (attacks that target it automatically hit, as a totem does not defend itself). The knight can use his totems to add one of his additional characteristics per totem, without overdrives, to a test he performs. As with assistance, the characteristics must be different each time. They can be used in combat or for any other action. Totems can be used for most tests, but the PC must always argue for their use and use them with the GM's agreement.</p>",

      "name": "Warlock",
      "description": "<p>At the origin of Avalon, its creators were primarily focused on developing versatile armaments, designed for all situations, to repel or kill each enemy of the Anathema. Over the months of struggle, numerous armor prototypes were designed, tested, and sometimes field-tested with varying results, sometimes positive, sometimes failures. This is how the Druid and Psion meta-armours were developed, and the prototypes of the Pistolero and Swashbuckler meta-armours were abandoned. But one meta-armour remained in the prototype phase for a long time, neither abandoned nor deployed in the field: the Warlock meta-armour.</p>\n<p>This armor is based on one of the qualities of the Anathema: its ability to distort and manipulate temporal rules. By collecting alpha element, the dark material found under the shadows, and subjecting it to numerous tests, the engineers of the Giant section and the scientists of the Cyclops section understood that the material could change its temporal state through certain manipulations. The alpha element is thus capable of regenerating by moving back a few seconds in time or, conversely, being displaced rapidly by moving forward a few seconds into the future. It can even be duplicated for a few moments, existing twice at the same time. Building on this discovery, Gauvain and Dagonnet attempted to develop a meta-armour, composed mainly of alpha element, that could manipulate its own temporal state and thus repair itself by moving back in time or move rapidly and replicate for a few seconds. Unfortunately, the integrity of the equipment was quickly compromised after temporal manipulation, and worse still, the wearer suffered numerous physical and mental repercussions that left them quickly exhausted and almost mad.</p>\n<p>Month after month, the two knights of the Round Table conducted tests without success but did not want to abandon this promising concept. Surprisingly, it was Sagramor who found the solution. Responsible for supervising the first trials conducted by members of his section, the knight of the Round Table quickly realized that what damaged the wearers of the meta-armour was the fact that they did not change temporal state while the armor did. They were thus violently transported from one time to another, and both body and mind were disturbed. For the wearers to follow the meta-armour in these changes, they needed to be fitted with a complete, hermetic suit composed mainly of alpha element and connected to tiny bodily implants made of the same material and distributed throughout the body... with the obvious implications for their hope.</p>\n<p>With this solution in mind, tests were conducted again. The suit and the implants of dark material allowed the wearer to better resist, and surprisingly, the integrity of the armor seemed to increase, as if the wearer and the equipment were in true symbiosis. Unfortunately, after days and days of tests, Dagonnet and Gauvain realized that if the testers no longer suffered physical and mental repercussions, they seemed to become detached from time over the course of the trials.</p>\n<p>Thus, the few knights designated to test the prototype in the field began to experience small memory losses and felt out of phase, as if they no longer belonged to the correct timeline. A minor evil compared to the martial qualities of the meta-armour.</p>\n<br /><br /><p>The Warlock meta-armour was designed to quickly take down Avalon's targets and retreat just as quickly. It is a martial, violent armor, but its use remains dangerous. The wearers of the Warlock know this well and use it with caution, as it sometimes seems to cause heavy changes in their person. They know that each use of one of the meta-armour's three capacities causes a different effect on them, which they will have to endure at some point.</p>\n<p>Although classified as a third-generation armor, the composition of the Warlock is unique within the entire arsenal of Avalon. Composed almost entirely of fine layers of alpha element, it exudes an impressive sense of anxiety, and its knotty appearance further reinforces this aspect. Lightweight, with substantial armor due to its composition and a powerful alpha energy core, it nevertheless has a rather weak force field, disrupted by the mass of alpha element that constitutes the armor. Each of the Warlock's capacities is also very energy-intensive and requires precise management by the wearer to avoid running out at the wrong moment, as while the meta-armour can cancel damage by returning in time, the energy does not seem to regenerate in this way.</p>\n<p>In appearance, the Warlock is a dark, long, and unsettling armor. The dark material covers it almost entirely, leaving only rare armor plates visible, and the whole seems to absorb light over a few centimeters. Many of its wearers try to improve its appearance with ornaments to make it less repulsive, but the alpha element always seems to dull these changes.</p>\n<p>Finally, the capacities of the Warlock meta-armour make it truly unique, and its operation can sometimes be difficult to understand for knights who have not tried it. To simplify, the Warlock only manipulates time on itself. The world around it undergoes no changes. Thus, for example, when the armor moves back in time a few seconds, it returns to its previous place and state, but everything around it, the environment, people, and monsters, does not experience any return to the past. Temporal manipulation is a personal power that acts only on the armor and its wearer but can be applied in many ways.</p>\n<br /><br /><p>The Warlock meta-armour has three capacities. They are associated with repercussions that must be taken into account and activated by the PC themselves.</p>\n",
      "forwardDescription": "<p style=\"text-align\">The meta-armour is capable of accelerating time on itself to move more quickly.</p><p style=text-align:justify;>The knight's movement ranges â whether normal movement or those granted by running, jumping, or flying modules â are increased by one level up to a maximum equal to long range. A contact range thus becomes a short range, a short range becomes a medium range, and a medium range becomes a long range. Beyond this, the integrity of the armour is too compromised for the AI to authorize such movement. Movement in a vehicle, movements granted by Level 1 or 3 Movement OD, and the teleportation module are not affected by this capability.</p>",

He must activate the mode before making his attack. It can be performed with a weapon or a module. In the next turn, he can perform his normal actions and activate the mode without any energy cost to reproduce exactly his attack performed in the previous turn, with a double of himself, like a remanence, appearing to strike or shoot again.</p><p style=text-align:justify;>The recorded attack action is reproduced identically. This means that the attack roll, damage or violence roll, range, and effects are exactly the same (even if the player spent a point of heroism to maximize damage). The energy spent to increase damage or add effects, as well as ammunition, do not need to be deducted again. However, the attack can be directed at the same target or another. Consequently, if the attack roll is not sufficient to hit, the attack simply fails and will have been recorded for nothing.</p><p style=text-align:justify;>Reproducing an attack costs no EP.</p><p style=text-align:justify;>Recording the attack as well as reproducing it costs no action.
